# SVG Grid

This is an svg grid in elm to run graph algorithms and simulations on. The dimensions
of the grid are fully parameterized, check out `Constants.elm`.

This project was inspired by a Tron game AI competition hosted by the Purdue Hackers.
I've been meaning to learn Elm for a while, and I wanted to try my hand at making
a Tron AI in Elm.

Currently there is no AI, just a breadth first search algorithm that runs on the
graph.
